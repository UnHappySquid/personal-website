						<p>
							As the drone division of the McGill Robotics Club, our objective
							is to
							design and develop an autonomous drone to compete in the 2025 <a
								href="https://suas-competition.org/">SUAS
								competition</a> . The mission requires the
							drone to autonomously perform a series of complex tasks within
							strict
							constraints. Initially, the drone must autonomously take off and
							navigate through 10 predetermined waypoints, maintaining course
							within
							the designated mission boundaries while actively avoiding
							obstacles such
							as trees and another UAV operating simultaneously in the same
							airspace.
						</p>
						<p>
							After navigating these waypoints, the drone is tasked with
							autonomously
							locating and identifying targets placed in a designated area on
							the
							ground. These targets may include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Person/Mannequin</li>
							<li>Car (&gt;1:8 scale model)</li>
							<li>Motorcycle (&gt;1:8 scale model)</li>
							<li>Airplane (&gt;3m wingspan model)</li>
							<li>Bus (&gt;1:8 scale model)</li>
							<li>Boat (&gt;1:8 scale model)</li>
							<li>Stop Sign (flat, upwards-facing)</li>
							<li>Snowboard</li>
							<li>Umbrella</li>
							<li>Sports Ball (soccer, basketball, volleyball, or football)
							</li>
							<li>Baseball Bat</li>
							<li>Bed/Mattress (larger than twin size)</li>
							<li>Tennis Racket</li>
							<li>Suitcase</li>
							<li>Skis</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Once the drone identifies the specified target, it must perform
							a
							precise water-bottle airdrop directly onto it. This waypoint
							identification and payload delivery must be repeated a total of
							four
							times. Following successful completion, the drone must
							autonomously
							return and safely land at its initial takeoff point. The entire
							mission
							must be completed within a 30-minute time limit, which demands
							careful
							management of energy resources.
						</p>
						<p>
							To effectively meet these demanding criteria, our team decided
							to
							develop a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft, which
							combines
							the agility and maneuverability of a quadcopter with the speed
							and
							endurance advantages of fixed-wing flight. This hybrid design
							introduces
							considerable complexity, particularly in software management of
							the
							flight transitions between quadcopter and fixed-wing modes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Throughout the project, our team conducted extensive requirement
							elicitation and detailed system design, resulting in a
							comprehensive
							architecture represented by a ROS2 node graph:
						</p>
						<br>
						<img src="./media/ros_nodes.png" alt="ros nodes graph">
						<p>
							Currently, our progress includes completing the drone’s flight
							controller node in C++, as well as portions of the mapping
							nodes. Given
							my substantial prior experience with the PX4 flight controller
							firmware—acquired through extensive documentation research
							during last
							year's competition—I developed the controller in C++ to ensure
							optimal
							real-time performance on our constrained onboard computer, the
							Jetson
							Orin Nano. This choice marked a deliberate departure from the
							previous
							year's Python implementation, which proved inadequate for the
							system's
							real-time demands. Despite the complexity introduced by
							transitioning
							from a pure quadcopter to a hybrid VTOL system, our iterative
							development process, rigorous testing, and perseverance have
							resulted in
							a robust and reliable flight controller.
						</p>
						<p>
							Parallel to the flight software development, other team members
							have
							been generating a custom dataset for training and fine-tuning
							the
							drone’s computer vision models. Utilizing Blender’s scripting
							capabilities, this dataset aims to provide accurate recognition
							and
							classification of the diverse targets listed above.
						</p>
						<p>
							As this project is ongoing, further developments are
							anticipated. For
							reference, additional information on the drone built for the
							2024
							competition, which shares similar goals, can be consulted.

							For The CodeJam 14 hackathon, we tackled the challenge outlined
							in <a href="https://github.com/Matador-AI/Codejam14">this
								repository</a>, which required us to develop an AI
							chatbot capable of assisting customers in finding cars based on
							their preferences. The goal was to create an engaging and
							efficient chatbot that could retrieve and process relevant car
							listings while maintaining a distinct personality.
						</p>
						<h3>Project Breakdown</h3>
						<p>Our team of two split responsibilities: I focused on developing the
							backend AI chatbot, while my teammate handled the frontend and
							server endpoints. To achieve our goal of a chatbot capable of
							retrieving relevant data, I needed to research retrieval methods
							and discovered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).</p>
						<h3>Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h3>
						<p>RAG is a framework that enhances a language model’s responses by
							retrieving relevant data from an external knowledge base before
							generating an answer. This was ideal for our chatbot, as it
							allowed us to dynamically fetch relevant car listings rather
							than relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, reducing
							hallucination and improving response accuracy.</p>
						<h3>Creating the ChillGuy Personality</h3>
						<p>Beyond functionality, we wanted our chatbot to embody the personality
							of the 'My New Character' meme—relaxed, easygoing, and
							nonchalant. This required careful prompt engineering to ensure
							the AI’s tone remained in line with this persona.</p>
						<h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
						<p>One key decision was to avoid reliance on external APIs like OpenAI’s
							models or Pinecone’s vector database. Instead, I opted for
							open-source models and self-hosted vector search to ensure
							independence and scalability. This led me to LangChain, a
							framework designed for building AI-powered applications with
							composable modules.</p>
						<h3>Why LangChain?</h3>
						<p>LangChain provided the necessary tools to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Integrate local models via Ollama, which simplified running
								LLaMA models—the best available open-source LLM at the
								time.</li>
							<li>Utilize ChromaDB, a built-in local vector database for
								storing and searching embeddings.</li>
							<li>Enable retrieval-based augmentation, allowing us to
								dynamically fetch relevant car listings based on user
								queries.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Implementing the AI Backend</h3>
						<p>The chatbot's prompt structure consisted of four key components:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>System Prompt – Defined the chatbot’s goal and personality.
							</li>
							<li>Relevant Cars – A dynamic section populated through vector
								similarity search.</li>
							<li>Past Conversation History – Provided context by tracking
								previous interactions.</li>
							<li>Current User Prompt – The latest user query.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The challenge was in populating the 'Relevant Cars' section
							effectively. To achieve this:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Each car listing was converted into a document, embedded
								into a vector, and stored in ChromaDB.</li>
							<li>At query time, we performed vector similarity search,
								retrieving cars with embeddings closest to the user’s
								query.</li>
							<li>However, with 100,000 cars, each having 30+ attributes,
								embedding everything was computationally expensive. To
								meet the hackathon deadline, we:
								<ul>
									<li>Reduced the fields per car to 10 (e.g.,
										seats, condition, model, make).</li>
									<li>Moved computations to a Google Cloud Compute
										Engine with a powerful GPU.</li>
									<li>Optimized embeddings, reducing processing
										time from 10 minutes per 1,000 cars to
										embedding all cars in 30 minutes.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Final Submission & Lessons Learned</h3>
						<p>While our chatbot functioned, it occasionally hallucinated. Given
							more time, we could have improved its accuracy by:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Combining vector search with keyword search for better
								retrieval.</li>
							<li>Filtering duplicate car listings.</li>
							<li>Implementing a judge model to validate retrieved results
								before inclusion in the prompt.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Despite starting just 24 hours before the deadline (out of the
							allotted 50 hours) and being a team of two instead of four, we
							successfully built and deployed the chatbot. Our final
							submission is available here: <a
								href="https://devpost.com/software/chill-guy-chatbot">ChillGuy
								Chatbot</a>.</p>
						<p>This project was a deep dive into retrieval-augmented generation,
							prompt engineering, and AI system design, and served as a
							valuable learning experience in developing agentic AI models
							using open-source tools.</p>
