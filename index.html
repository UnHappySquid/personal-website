						<p>
							As the drone division of the McGill Robotics Club, our objective
							is to
							design and develop an autonomous drone to compete in the 2025 <a
								target="_blank"
								href="https://suas-competition.org/">SUAS
								competition</a> . The mission requires the
							drone to autonomously perform a series of complex tasks within
							strict
							constraints. Initially, the drone must autonomously take off and
							navigate through 10 predetermined waypoints, maintaining course
							within
							the designated mission boundaries while actively avoiding
							obstacles such
							as trees and another UAV operating simultaneously in the same
							airspace.
						</p>
						<p>
							After navigating these waypoints, the drone is tasked with
							autonomously
							locating and identifying targets placed in a designated area on
							the
							ground. These targets may include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Person/Mannequin</li>
							<li>Car (&gt;1:8 scale model)</li>
							<li>Motorcycle (&gt;1:8 scale model)</li>
							<li>Airplane (&gt;3m wingspan model)</li>
							<li>Bus (&gt;1:8 scale model)</li>
							<li>Boat (&gt;1:8 scale model)</li>
							<li>Stop Sign (flat, upwards-facing)</li>
							<li>Snowboard</li>
							<li>Umbrella</li>
							<li>Sports Ball (soccer, basketball, volleyball, or football)
							</li>
							<li>Baseball Bat</li>
							<li>Bed/Mattress (larger than twin size)</li>
							<li>Tennis Racket</li>
							<li>Suitcase</li>
							<li>Skis</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Once the drone identifies the specified target, it must perform
							a
							precise water-bottle airdrop directly onto it. This waypoint
							identification and payload delivery must be repeated a total of
							four
							times. Following successful completion, the drone must
							autonomously
							return and safely land at its initial takeoff point. The entire
							mission
							must be completed within a 30-minute time limit, which demands
							careful
							management of energy resources.
						</p>
						<p>
							To effectively meet these demanding criteria, our team decided
							to
							develop a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft, which
							combines
							the agility and maneuverability of a quadcopter with the speed
							and
							endurance advantages of fixed-wing flight. This hybrid design
							introduces
							considerable complexity, particularly in software management of
							the
							flight transitions between quadcopter and fixed-wing modes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Throughout the project, our team conducted extensive requirement
							elicitation and detailed system design, resulting in a
							comprehensive
							architecture represented by a ROS2 node graph:
						</p>
						<br>
						<img src="./media/ros_nodes.png" alt="ros nodes graph">
						<p>
							Currently, our progress includes completing the drone’s flight
							controller node in C++, as well as portions of the mapping
							nodes. Given
							my substantial prior experience with the PX4 flight controller
							firmware—acquired through extensive documentation research
							during last
							year's competition—I developed the controller in C++ to ensure
							optimal
							real-time performance on our constrained onboard computer, the
							Jetson
							Orin Nano. This choice marked a deliberate departure from the
							previous
							year's Python implementation, which proved inadequate for the
							system's
							real-time demands. Despite the complexity introduced by
							transitioning
							from a pure quadcopter to a hybrid VTOL system, our iterative
							development process, rigorous testing, and perseverance have
							resulted in
							a robust and reliable flight controller.
						</p>
						<p>
							Parallel to the flight software development, other team members
							have
							been generating a custom dataset for training and fine-tuning
							the
							drone’s computer vision models. Utilizing Blender’s scripting
							capabilities, this dataset aims to provide accurate recognition
							and
							classification of the diverse targets listed above.
						</p>
						<p>
							As this project is ongoing, further developments are
							anticipated. For
							reference, additional information on the drone built for the
							2024
							competition, which shares similar goals, can be consulted.

							For The CodeJam 14 hackathon, we tackled the challenge outlined
							in <a target="_blank"
								href="https://github.com/Matador-AI/Codejam14">this
								repository</a>, which required us to develop an AI
							chatbot capable of assisting customers in finding cars based on
							their preferences. The goal was to create an engaging and
							efficient chatbot that could retrieve and process relevant car
							listings while maintaining a distinct personality.
						</p>
						<h3>Project Breakdown</h3>
						<p>Our team of two split responsibilities: I focused on developing the
							backend AI chatbot, while my teammate handled the frontend and
							server endpoints. To achieve our goal of a chatbot capable of
							retrieving relevant data, I needed to research retrieval methods
							and discovered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).</p>
						<h3>Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h3>
						<p>RAG is a framework that enhances a language model’s responses by
							retrieving relevant data from an external knowledge base before
							generating an answer. This was ideal for our chatbot, as it
							allowed us to dynamically fetch relevant car listings rather
							than relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, reducing
							hallucination and improving response accuracy.</p>
						<h3>Creating the ChillGuy Personality</h3>
						<p>Beyond functionality, we wanted our chatbot to embody the personality
							of the 'My New Character' meme—relaxed, easygoing, and
							nonchalant. This required careful prompt engineering to ensure
							the AI’s tone remained in line with this persona.</p>
						<h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
						<p>One key decision was to avoid reliance on external APIs like OpenAI’s
							models or Pinecone’s vector database. Instead, I opted for
							open-source models and self-hosted vector search to ensure
							independence and scalability. This led me to LangChain, a
							framework designed for building AI-powered applications with
							composable modules.</p>
						<h3>Why LangChain?</h3>
						<p>LangChain provided the necessary tools to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Integrate local models via Ollama, which simplified running
								LLaMA models—the best available open-source LLM at the
								time.</li>
							<li>Utilize ChromaDB, a built-in local vector database for
								storing and searching embeddings.</li>
							<li>Enable retrieval-based augmentation, allowing us to
								dynamically fetch relevant car listings based on user
								queries.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Implementing the AI Backend</h3>
						<p>The chatbot's prompt structure consisted of four key components:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>System Prompt – Defined the chatbot’s goal and personality.
							</li>
							<li>Relevant Cars – A dynamic section populated through vector
								similarity search.</li>
							<li>Past Conversation History – Provided context by tracking
								previous interactions.</li>
							<li>Current User Prompt – The latest user query.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The challenge was in populating the 'Relevant Cars' section
							effectively. To achieve this:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Each car listing was converted into a document, embedded
								into a vector, and stored in ChromaDB.</li>
							<li>At query time, we performed vector similarity search,
								retrieving cars with embeddings closest to the user’s
								query.</li>
							<li>However, with 100,000 cars, each having 30+ attributes,
								embedding everything was computationally expensive. To
								meet the hackathon deadline, we:
								<ul>
									<li>Reduced the fields per car to 10 (e.g.,
										seats, condition, model, make).</li>
									<li>Moved computations to a Google Cloud Compute
										Engine with a powerful GPU.</li>
									<li>Optimized embeddings, reducing processing
										time from 10 minutes per 1,000 cars to
										embedding all cars in 30 minutes.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Final Submission & Lessons Learned</h3>
						<p>While our chatbot functioned, it occasionally hallucinated. Given
							more time, we could have improved its accuracy by:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Combining vector search with keyword search for better
								retrieval.</li>
							<li>Filtering duplicate car listings.</li>
							<li>Implementing a judge model to validate retrieved results
								before inclusion in the prompt.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Despite starting just 24 hours before the deadline (out of the
							allotted 50 hours) and being a team of two instead of four, we
							successfully built and deployed the chatbot. Our final
							submission is available here: <a target="_blank"
								href="https://devpost.com/software/chill-guy-chatbot">ChillGuy
								Chatbot</a>.</p>
						<p>This project was a deep dive into retrieval-augmented generation,
							prompt engineering, and AI system design, and served as a
							valuable learning experience in developing agentic AI models
							using open-source tools.</p>

					<div class="project_deets_deets">
						<p>As part of the McGill Robotics Club, our team was tasked with
							developing an autonomous drone for the SUAS Competition 2024 (<a
								target="_blank"
								href="https://suas-competition.org/">SUAS Website</a>).
							This competition fosters interest in Unmanned Aerial Systems
							(UAS) and requires teams to design a fully autonomous drone
							capable of performing complex aerial missions.</p>
						<h3>Competition Requirements & Constraints</h3>
						<p>The competition involved designing a drone that could autonomously:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Take off and navigate through 10 waypoints while remaining
								within a defined mission boundary.</li>
							<li>Identify and classify targets—either a mannequin or a paper
								cutout of a shape containing a letter, where the
								combination of shape and letter colors uniquely
								identified the target.</li>
							<li>Perform four precise airdrops, matching each airdrop payload
								(a water bottle) to its designated target.</li>
							<li>
								Adhere to flight constraints:
								<ul>
									<li>Maintain an altitude between 50 to 400 feet
										Above Ground Level (AGL).</li>
									<li>Complete the mission within 30 minutes.</li>
									<li>Operate with a maximum of two human
										operators to avoid penalties.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Given these constraints, the team initially planned a VTOL (Vertical
							Takeoff and Landing) drone to maximize endurance and efficiency,
							allowing for long-range waypoint navigation while maintaining
							precise control during takeoff, landing, and airdrops.</p>
						<h3>Leadership Challenges & Project Restart</h3>
						<p>The project struggled early on due to the absence of a software lead,
							leaving the team without clear direction and resulting in
							significant member attrition. As one of the more experienced
							developers remaining, I was asked to step in as software lead.
							However, I had never worked under a lead before, making it
							difficult to structure the team's efforts effectively.</p>
						<p>Additionally, midterms and finals led to decreased participation,
							with most of the software team only completing ROS2 tutorials
							without writing any actual code. While the tutorials were
							intended to build familiarity with ROS2, many members struggled
							to translate that knowledge into practical implementation,
							leading to stagnation in development. By the end of winter
							break, the project lacked both a working codebase and a clear
							design.</p>
						<p>To address this, I applied requirement elicitation techniques from my
							software engineering class, analyzing the rulebook to create:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>An environment model</li>
							<li>A domain model</li>
							<li>A concept model (see below)</li>
						</ol>
						<img src="media/concept_model_drone_2024.png"
							alt="autonomous drone 2024 concept model">
						<p>With a structured plan in place, I reassigned tasks. However, many
							team members lacked confidence, struggled with the complexity of
							their assignments, and were unsure how to proceed. Some had
							difficulty applying theoretical knowledge to practical
							implementation, while others felt overwhelmed by the project
							scope, leading to delays in task completion. Over time, I had to
							take on the majority of the software development myself, as
							unreliable contributions were delaying progress.</p>
						<h3>Adapting Scope & System Design</h3>
						<p>With competition two months away, we faced a major constraint—VTOL
							functionality was not feasible in time due to a combination of
							technical complexity, lack of prior experience with VTOL
							systems, and the time required to integrate and test the
							transition between quadcopter and fixed-wing flight. We pivoted
							to a quadcopter-only approach, requiring a rapid software
							redesign. I created a <a target="_blank"
								href="https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes.html#understanding-nodes">ROS2
								node architecture</a> to handle mission
							execution:</p>
						<img src="media/ROS2_node_diagram_drone_2024.png"
							alt="autonomous drone 2024 ros diagram">
						<h3>ROS2 Node Architecture</h3>
						<p>The architecture consisted of the following key nodes:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Offboard Node - Implements an action queue (takeoff, land,
								waypoint navigation) and abstracts communication with
								the PX4 flight controller, simplifying interactions for
								other nodes. This setup streamlined command execution
								and drone state monitoring but restricted us to
								quadcopter mode because MicroXRCE, a module that exposes
								PX4's internal pub-sub topics as ROS topics, lacked
								support for VTOL transitions.</li>
							<li>Local Planner (VFH+) - A Vector Field Histogram Plus (VFH+)
								planner for navigating towards waypoints while avoiding
								mission boundary violations. Originally designed for
								obstacle avoidance, but due to hardware
								limitations—specifically, the lack of suitable onboard
								sensors and insufficient processing power to handle
								real-time obstacle detection—we had to disable this
								functionality.</li>
							<li>Mission Node - A finite state machine that managed mission
								execution by determining the sequence and logic of topic
								publications for each mission state. It acted as the
								central controller, orchestrating the entire drone
								operation. The possible states included WAITING,
								PERFORMING_LAP, SURVEY_AREA, PERFORMING_AIRDROP, and RTH
								(Return to Home). Additionally, this was the primary
								node that users interacted with to set mission
								parameters and initiate the mission start signal.</li>
							<li>
								Dummy CV (Computer Vision Node) - Handled target
								identification during the survey phase using two YOLOv8
								models:
								<ul>
									<li>One model detected shapes and letters, while
										the other was used for mannequins.</li>
									<li>The color detection is done through various
										OpenCV utilities and the HSV color
										space.</li>
									<li>Once a target was identified, its ground
										position was calculated and sent to the
										mission node.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Airdrop Controller (Micro ROS Node) - Ran on an Arduino Due,
								responsible for controlling the airdrop mechanism via
								ROS commands. It supported arming and releasing payloads
								on specific hubs.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Competition Outcome & Lessons Learned</h3>
						<p>Despite numerous hurdles, we competed for the first time in four
							years. This was made possible by our ability to rapidly adapt to
							new constraints, streamline our mission scope, and dedicate
							intense effort in the final months to ensure a functional system
							was ready for competition. While we faced challenges in
							execution, given it was our first full-scale attempt, we gained
							valuable experience and insights for future competitions, we won
							the Tenacity Award for persevering through the challenges. This
							experience provided valuable insights into team leadership,
							rapid prototyping, and real-world autonomous system development.
							One key lesson was the importance of structured
							leadership—having a clear roadmap and assigning tasks
							effectively can make or break a project. Additionally, we
							learned that adaptability is crucial; simplifying our approach
							and pivoting to a quadcopter-only design allowed us to meet
							deadlines and still deliver a functional system. This trade-off
							sacrificed endurance and speed but significantly improved system
							stability and reduced integration complexity, making it a more
							viable solution within the competition’s constraints.</p>

						<p>As part of a year-long software engineering project class, our team
							of seven was tasked with developing an online multiplayer
							adaptation of Splendor, a turn-based competitive strategy card
							game. The project followed a structured development process with
							several milestones, culminating in a fully functional
							multiplayer game with a 92% final grade.</p>
						<h3>Project Scope & Technology Stack</h3>
						<p>We implemented the game using Java with the following technologies:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Backend: Spring Boot (RESTful API), PostgreSQL (database),
								Docker (deployment), MVC architecture.</li>
							<li>Frontend: JavaFX with FXGL (entity-component-based game
								engine) for dynamic UI and interactive gameplay.</li>
							<li>Networking: RESTful services to handle game sessions and
								player interactions.</li>
							<li>Deployment: Dockerized backend for consistent deployment
								across environments.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Development Process & Key Contributions</h3>
						<p>After completing early modeling milestones, our team began with the
							frontend implementation. My primary task was to develop in-game
							action prompts—a crucial component that involved handling 11
							different types of prompts. Anticipating future expansions, I
							implemented a Strategy Design Pattern, allowing for easy
							scalability and adaptability as new game rules and prompt types
							were introduced. This approach ensured a modular and
							maintainable prompt-handling system.</p>
						<p>For the backend, we set up Spring Boot and structured the codebase
							using MVC (Model-View-Controller) to ensure maintainability. My
							primary contributions included:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Designing and implementing RESTful API endpoints for
								client-server communication.</li>

							<li>Parsing incoming requests, converting them into
								backend-compatible models, and updating game state
								accordingly.</li>

							<li>Implementing long polling to synchronize the frontend with
								real-time model changes.</li>

							<li>Writing test cases to ensure 80%+ code coverage, following a
								test-driven development (TDD) approach.</li>

						</ul>
						<h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
						<p>Throughout the project, we faced several technical and organizational
							challenges:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Team Coordination & Task Management: Regular meetings were
								held to align tasks, discuss progress, and tackle
								complex features collaboratively.</li>

							<li>Scalability & Maintainability: The use of Microservices
								Architecture improved system modularity and performance.
							</li>

							<li>Secure User Authentication & Data Management: PostgreSQL
								managed user information, including hashed credentials
								and game session data.</li>

							<li>Deployment Consistency: Docker was used to containerize the
								backend, ensuring smooth deployment across different
								environments.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Final Outcome & Lessons Learned</h3>
						<p>For our final milestone, we successfully delivered a fully functional
							multiplayer card game supporting real-time online play for at
							least three concurrent players across separate machines. Our
							implementation adhered to official Splendor game rules,
							including turn-based mechanics, resource management, and victory
							conditions.</p>
						<p>This project reinforced my skills in collaborative software
							development, system architecture design, RESTful API
							development, and UI/UX implementation. It also validated my
							passion for writing clean, maintainable code while working in a
							team-driven environment.</p>
